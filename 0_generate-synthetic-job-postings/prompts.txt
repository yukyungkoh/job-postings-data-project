   prompt = f"""
        Generate a realistic and varied U.S. job title for a role in the {sector} sector.
	For example, in the "{sector}" sector, consider a wide range of job types—e.g., client-facing, operational, strategy, support, compliance, leadership, and technical roles.
        Then write a corresponding online job posting.
        
        **Job Title Instructions**:
        - Most titles should **not** have seniority indicator. Many should just say things like "Data Analyst" or "Marketing Manager".
        - Vary structure and formatting: include tools, certifications, or location (e.g., "Remote", "Hybrid") **occasionally**, not always.
        - Use a mix of clean, formal titles and messier, casual, or acronym-heavy titles to simulate real-world postings on LinkedIn or Indeed.
	- Cover a wide range of functional areas within the sector. For example:
    		- In **finance**, don't just generate analyst roles—include investment banking, private equity, compliance, treasury, portfolio management, FP&A, controller, and client-facing finance roles.
   		- In **software engineering**, vary between front-end, back-end, DevOps, infrastructure, QA, and managerial positions.
   		- In **marketing**, include brand, growth, digital, product marketing, PR, and communications roles.
	- Examples of varied titles in the {sector} sector might include:
		- Finance: Investment Banking Associate, M&A Analyst, Financial Analyst, Wealth Strategy Consultant, Financial Modeling Lead
		- Data Science: Data Scientist, AI Research Associate, ML Ops Engineer, Data Strategy Consultant, Predictive Analytics Specialist
		- Software Engineering: Software Engineer, SDE, SDE II, Software Development Manager

        **Job Posting Instructions**:
        - Vary the format: mix bullet points and paragraphs.
	- Vary the opening sentence structure. Avoid repeating phrases like "We are seeking" or "We are looking for." Use a mix of tones and openings, such as:
  		- Describe the team or mission first.
  		- Begin with a bold statement or challenge ("Ready to shape the future of...?")
  		- Start with a benefit, opportunity, or company vision.
 		 - Use varied verbs (e.g., "Join", "Collaborate", "Help lead", "Support", "Drive", etc.).
        - Include responsibilities, qualifications, and location.
        - Randomly include or exclude DEI language and benefits.
        - {pay_note}
        - Introduce light "real-world noise": occasional grammatical quirks, inconsistent punctuation, typos, or abbreviation use (e.g., "exp." for experience, "req." for requirements). Not in every post — just enough to make the data look realistic.
        - Do not explicitly repeat the job title or sector name within the job description body. Instead, describe tasks and qualifications more naturally.
        
        **Format**:
        ### Job Title
        <your job title>
        
        ### Job Posting
        <your posting>
        
        **Instruction for format**
        Only use the ### Job Title and ### Job Posting headers once — at the top. 
        Do not repeat them or include any footer text.

         Then write a corresponding online job posting.

         **Job Title Instructions**:
         - Vary the actual seniority level of the role (entry-level, mid-level, senior-level).
         - Most titles should **not** have seniority indicator. Many should just say things like "Data Analyst" or "Marketing Manager".

         - Vary structure and formatting: include tools, certifications, or location (e.g., "Remote", "Hybrid") **occasionally**, not always.
         - Use a mix of clean, formal titles and messier, casual, or acronym-heavy titles to simulate real-world postings on LinkedIn or Indeed.

             - Entry-level: simple duties, minimal requirements.
             - Mid-level: 2–5 years experience, moderate complexity.
             - Senior-level: leadership, decision-making, advanced qualifications.
         - Write everything as full sentences and paragraphs. No bullet points. 
	 - Vary the opening sentence structure. Avoid repeating phrases like "We are seeking" or "We are looking for." Use a mix of tones and openings, such as:
  		- Describe the team or mission first.
  		- Begin with a bold statement or challenge ("Ready to shape the future of...?")

         - Randomly include or exclude DEI language and benefits.
