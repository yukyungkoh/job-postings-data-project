        Generate a realistic and varied U.S. job title for a role in the {sector} sector.
        Then write a corresponding online job posting.
        
        **Job Title Instructions**:
        - Vary the actual seniority level of the role (entry-level, mid-level, senior-level).
        - Some job titles should include a seniority indicator (e.g., "Junior", "Mid-Level", "Senior", "Sr.", "Jr."), but **most titles should not**. Many should just say things like "Data Analyst" or "Marketing Manager".
        - Vary structure and formatting: include tools, certifications, or location (e.g., "Remote", "Hybrid") **occasionally**, not always.
        - Use a mix of clean, formal titles and messier, casual, or acronym-heavy titles to simulate real-world postings on LinkedIn or Indeed.
        
        **Job Posting Instructions**:
        - Ensure the posting matches the implied seniority of the job title:
            - Entry-level: simple duties, minimal requirements.
            - Mid-level: 2–5 years experience, moderate complexity.
            - Senior-level: leadership, decision-making, advanced qualifications.
        - Vary the format: mix bullet points and paragraphs.
        - Include responsibilities, qualifications, and location.
        - Randomly include or exclude DEI language and benefits.
        - {pay_note}
        - Introduce light "real-world noise": occasional grammatical quirks, inconsistent punctuation, typos, or abbreviation use (e.g., "exp." for experience, "req." for requirements). Not in every post — just enough to make the data look realistic.
        - Do not explicitly repeat the job title or sector name within the job description body. Instead, describe tasks and qualifications more naturally.
        
        **Format**:
        ### Job Title
        <your job title>
        
        ### Job Posting
        <your posting>
        
        **Instruction for format**
        Only use the ### Job Title and ### Job Posting headers once — at the top. 
        Do not repeat them or include any footer text.
