# Job Postings Data Project

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and scripts aimed at learning how to apply **natural language processing (NLP)** and **large language models (LLMs)** to extract structured insights from messy, unstructured **job postings**. Using **synthetic** data, the project explores methods for leveraging job posting data to analyze the labor market. 

**‚ùì Why Use Synthetic Job Postings?**

- Access to real job posting data from platforms like LinkedIn is limited due to licensing restrictions and proprietary constraints.
- **Synthetic job postings** generated with LLMs offer a practical alternative: they are safe to use, fully customizable, and scalable -- making them ideal for experimentation and learning.
- **Important Note:** Because this project relies on synthetic data, the results should _**not**_ be interpreted as reflective of the real job market. The focus is on demonstrating how different techniques can be applied to job posting data in principle.
- You can explore how I generated the synthetic data in [this folder](https://github.com/yukyungkoh/job-postings-data-project/tree/main/0_generate-synthetic-job-postings).

The remainder of the project is organized into the following parts:

## üî∑ Part 1: Categorize Jobs 
This section explores multiple NLP approaches for classifying jobs into categories, including:
- Rule-based methods
- Supervised learning (e.g., logistic regression, Naive Bayes)
- Unsupervised learning (e.g., k-means clustering, LDA topic modeling)

## üî∑ Part 2: Extract Job Skills 
This section focuses on extracting job skills and task descriptions from job posting text using:
- Keyword matching to a curated skill list (from Lightcast)
- Large language models (LLMs), combined with Embedding + Clustering

## üî∑ Part 3: Measure AI Demand Exposure  
This section estimates the **AI exposure** of job tasks -- i.e., how susceptible the listed tasks in job postings are to automation or augmentation by AI tools. It builds on task-level extraction to compute AI relevance scores.
