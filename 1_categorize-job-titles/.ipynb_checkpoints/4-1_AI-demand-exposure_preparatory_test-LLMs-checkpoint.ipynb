    "### General Goals:\n",
    "* Construct AI Demand Exposure Score, which measures how susceptible job tasks listed in new postings are to augmentation or replacement by AI\n",
    "* I am going to follow the approach in 2025 Revelio Labs report \"AI at Work: The State of AI Adoption in 2025\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to construct the AI demand exposure score:**\n",
    "* **PART #1:** Extract tasks from job postings **-> ‚ÄºÔ∏èFOCUS OF THIS CODE‚ÄºÔ∏è**\n",
    "   * Extract clean and relevant task-like phrases (e.g., \"analyze data\", \"prepare reports\")\n",
    "   * Find a way to ignore the boilerplate sections (e.g., DEI statements, benefits).\n",
    "     * => Going to use LLM to extract action/task-oriented lines\n",
    "* **PART #2:** Map tasks to a taxonomy (optional but strongly recommended)\n",
    "    * Standardize the language of tasks across postings (like Revelio‚Äôs ‚Äúactivities taxonomy‚Äù)\n",
    "    * Alternatively, cluster similar task phrases using embeddings + k-means or sentence similarity.\n",
    "* **PART #3:** Score Task Susceptibility to AI (Using GPT or LLM)\n",
    "  * Goal: Determine whether a task can be augmented or automated by AI.\n",
    "  * Use GPT-4 or similar model with a prompt like:\n",
    "    * \"Can the following task be automated or enhanced using AI tools such as ChatGPT, image recognition, or robotic process automation? Respond 'Yes' or 'No' and briefly justify.\"\n",
    "    * Input: one task per call (or a batch, if needed).\n",
    "    * Response: Boolean + rationale (you can discard rationale for speed).\n",
    "  * Store the binary AI-susceptibility flag for each task.\n",
    "* **PART #4:** Compute the AI Demand Exposure Score\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### In this code:\n",
    "* I test a few LLMs on a small sample of job postings for task extraction.\n",
    "* This will help me choose the most suitable LLM for extracting tasks from the full dataset, which would otherwise be time-consuming.\n",
    "* **Heads-up:**\n",
    "  * I learned that **mistral model via Ollama** outperforms other executable models (e.g. flat-t5) on my Macbook.\n",
    "  * This will be discussed in detail in SECTION 5. \n",

    "## SECTION 1: Ways to extract task descriptions from unstructured, messy job postings\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main ways to extract task description from unstructured job postings. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1: ML-based sentence classification\n",
    "* Train a binary classifier to label each sentence in a job posting as: **task-related** (1) or **not task-related** (0)\n",
    "* How to implement\n",
    "  1. Split job postings into sentences.\n",
    "  2. Label a small training set (manually tag ~500‚Äì1,000 sentences).\n",
    "  3. Fine-tune a transformer like distilbert-base-uncased or roberta-base on this sentence classification task.\n",
    "  4. Apply model to reset the rest of the job postings.\n",
    "* **‚úÖ Pros**: High flexibility and adaptability, Handles varying structures well\n",
    "* **‚ùå Cons**: Requires some labeled data and compute,  Harder to debug than rules\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Option 2: LLM-based zero-shot or few-shot classification    **-> ‚ÄºÔ∏èBEST APPROACH‚ÄºÔ∏è**\n",
    "* Use GPT (or other LLM) to label sentences or extract task descriptions directly.\n",
    "    * üî® Prompt Example:\n",
    "    \"Below is a job posting. Extract only the specific tasks that an employee would be expected to perform in this role. Ignore company values, benefits, and general statements.\"\n",
    "    * Then pass the full job posting, or chunks of it, and parse the output.\n",
    "* **‚úÖ Pros**: No training required, Often very accurate on diverse formats\n",
    "* **‚ùå Cons**: Slower, Costs may add up if processing many postings, May require post-cleaning to standardize output\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 3: Heuristic-based rules (regex + patterns)\n",
    "* I can combine the following rules:\n",
    "    1. Bullet Points or Imperative Sentences\n",
    "        * Regex: r\"^\\s*[-‚Ä¢*]\\s+.+\"\n",
    "        * Captures bullet-style task listings.\n",
    "    2. Verb-First Sentences\n",
    "        * Use POS tagging to retain sentences that begin with strong verbs (VB, VBP, VBZ).\n",
    "    3. Section-Based Extraction\n",
    "        * Try to identify \"Job Responsibilities\", \"What You‚Äôll Do\", \"Duties\" sections using regex or keyword matching, and extract bullet points or paragraphs under them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **‚ùå Cons**: Not straightforward with the data I have, which may not have bullet points (Rule 1) or clear section titles (Rule 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### ‚úÖ Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "As demonstrated above, **mistral model via Ollama** outperforms the **flan-t5-large model** in extracting job tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mistral is **faster**, taking 4 minutes to process 10 job postings, compared to 6 minutes with flan-t5-large.\n",
    "* Mistral handles **much longer inputs**, while flan-t5-large has a 512-token limit. This causes input truncation, potentially missing tasks listed toward the end of a posting.\n",
    "* In terms of the **quality of \"extracted_tasks\"**, Mistral performs significantly better, especially for longer job postings (e.g. Job posting 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ÄºÔ∏è Therefore, I decided to use the **Mistral** model to extract job tasks from all job postings. ‚ÄºÔ∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I became curious why Mistral via Ollama runs on my computer, while `HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta` does not‚Äîdespite both models having 7 billion parameters.\n",
    "* The reason is that Mistral via Ollama runs better on my Mac because it uses a **quantized** model, loaded with a lightweight C++ engine optimized for Apple Silicon (M1/M2). It uses less RAM. \n",
    "* whereas models from Hugging Face often run in full precision using PyTorch, which is heavy and not optimized for Mac.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, I summarize the differences between Mistral and Flan-T5, with help from ChatGPT.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",

    "| Feature               | **Mistral**                            | **Flan-T5**                                   |\n",
