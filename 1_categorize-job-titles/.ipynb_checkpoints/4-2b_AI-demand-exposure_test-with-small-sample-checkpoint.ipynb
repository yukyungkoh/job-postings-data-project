    "# 4-2. Construct AI Demand Exposure Score - PART 1: Task Extraction - Test prompt for 10 job postings\n",
    "\n",
    "Job posting data is provided by: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author:** Yu Kyung Koh\n",
    "\n",
    "**Last Updated:** 2025/06/21\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **!!!! ONLY CHECKING FOR 10 job postings!!!!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I check what would be the best way to (i) extract tasks and (ii) chunk each posting to label it as task or non-task. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Goals:\n",
    "* Construct AI Demand Exposure Score, which measures how susceptible job tasks listed in new postings are to augmentation or replacement by AI\n",
    "* I am going to follow the approach in 2025 Revelio Labs report \"AI at Work: The State of AI Adoption in 2025\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### In this code:\n",
    "* As noted in the preparatory step (Code 4-1), I found that **Ollama** is the most effective tool for extracting job tasks given my resource constraints.\n",
    "     * => Here, I apply Ollama to a larger set of job postings, focusing on specific job categories such as data-related roles, consulting, finance, and others.\n",
    "* ‼️ However, it is **computationally infeasible** to apply Ollama to all 30,000 job postings.\n",
    "  * The estimated runtime is approximately 8 days (30 seconds for each posting), even for this relatively small datset.\n",
    "* To address this, I combine **LLM-based** extraction with a **machine learning classifier** to scale up task extraction across the full dataset efficiently:\n",
    "  * **Step 1:** Use **Mistral via Ollama** to extract tasks from 100 job postings per job category.\n",
    "  * **Step 2:** Convert the extracted outputs into sentence-level **training data**, labeling sentences as task-related or not.\n",
    "  * **Step 3:** Train a lightweight and fast classifier (e.g., **DistilBERT**) to distinguish task sentences.\n",
    "  * **Step 4:** For the full dataset, split job postings into individual sentences\n",
    "  * **Step 5:** Apply the trained classifier to each sentence to identify task-related content at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note:\n",
    "* Before running this code, I need to type \"ollama run mistral\" in the terminal\n",
